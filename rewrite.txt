Got it — the **“?”** makes sense. Nothing is wrong with the plan.
You’re simply **blocked on fixtures**, not on design.

Here’s the precise situation, grounded in the file you just surfaced.

## What’s actually blocking Step 5a (one thing)

Your **Step 5a harness already exists and builds**, but it **cannot run** because it has **no concrete rewrite fixtures** to exercise. That’s it.

From the report you uploaded :

> *“The Step 5a harness is ready to run multiple rewrite scheduling policies and compare canonical witnesses, but it cannot proceed without concrete fixtures.”*

So the “?” resolves to:

> **We need to define the test inputs, not the machinery.**

## What is missing (explicit checklist)

You need to provide **at least three**, preferably **five**, SID rewrite scenarios, each consisting of:

1. **Initial diagram `D₀`**

   * Small (6–12 nodes)
   * Valid SID SSP / ternary diagram
2. **Rewrite rule set `R`**

   * JSON / CLI-friendly
   * Stable rule IDs
3. **Engine params `P`**

   * node count
   * role
   * any required knobs
4. **Horizon cap**

   * max rewrite steps before declaring non-termination

Without these, policies P1–P5 literally have nothing to schedule.

## Minimal unblocking set (recommended)

The report already tells you the *right* minimal set :

### Fixture 1 — Commuting rewrites

* Non-overlapping matches
* Should trivially converge
* Proves baseline path-independence

### Fixture 2 — Overlapping rewrites

* Same nodes eligible for multiple rules
* This is the **real Step 5a test**

### Fixture 3 — Cycle-prone diagram

* Forces termination / cycle detection logic
* Confirms failure mode F4 is handled cleanly

You do **not** need physics.
You do **not** need new theory.
You just need *rewrite-exercising structure*.
