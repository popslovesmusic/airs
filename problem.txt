Problem: Unable to run new Step 5a overlap/multi-redex fixtures because SID CLI cannot load diagrams; rebuild also failing.

Current observations:
- Added fixtures:
  - fixtures/step5a/scenario_overlap/{diagram.json,rules.json}
  - fixtures/step5a/scenario_multiredeux/{diagram.json,rules.json}
- Creating SID engine succeeds, but sid_set_diagram_json fails with EXECUTION_FAILED (last_rewrite_message empty). Minimal {id, nodes(op=P,dof_refs), edges=[]} also fails.
- Metrics after set attempt stay at zero; suggests diagram never loads.
- Copied Simulation/dase_cli contents into build/Debug; binaries run but same diagram-load failure.
- Rebuild with “cmake --build build --config Debug” times out; MSVC errors: /O2 and /RTC1 incompatible in multiple projects (dase_cli, sid_ssp_capi, dase_core, etc.), so Debug artifacts may be inconsistent after prior build/Debug deletion.

Needed decisions:
1) Fix build flags to complete a clean Debug (or Release) build with working dase_cli/sid support, then rerun fixtures.
2) Provide a known-good binary to use instead of rebuilding.
3) If sid_set_diagram_json expects a different schema, share the required schema so fixtures can be adapted.

Next action awaiting guidance.
