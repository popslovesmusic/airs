**Phase 1: Core Contract Validation (Complete)**
Goal: Prove system rules correct.
Tests: CLI parsing, Error format, Lifecycle, Determinism, Numeric invariants, State evolution.
Result: 19/19 PASS.

**Phase 2: Engine Family Validation (Next)**
Goal: Prove classes of engines obey contract.
Steps:
1.  Define engine families (IGSOA core, SATP Higgs, Analog/AVX2, FFT-backed, SID semantic).
2.  Representative engine test (Run unchanged harness for one canonical engine per family).

**Phase 3: Dimensional Variant Conformance**
Goal: Ensure dimension wiring correct.
Tests: create, step once, metrics valid, no NaN/Inf, destroy.

**Phase 4: Fleet Smoke Test**
Goal: Detect wiring errors for all 44 engines.
Tests: create, step, destroy, exit cleanly.

**Phase 5: Cross-Engine Invariant Checks**
Goal: Detect systemic issues (e.g., metrics schema consistency).
