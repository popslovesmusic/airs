# Manual Section 01: Framework Architecture

## 0.0 Preamble

This document defines the authoritative, layered architecture of the reasoning framework. The framework is structured as a hierarchical stack of formal systems, where each layer provides the foundational context and rules for the layers above it. This architecture ensures that logical evaluations are not only computationally correct but also possess deep ontological and mathematical legitimacy.

### 0.0.1 The Chain Governance Layer

While the stack below describes the layers of generation and evaluation, the sequence in which these layers are applied is not fixed. It is governed by a meta-system called the **Chain Governance Layer**. This layer defines a finite set of lawful "situations" and maps each to a unique, permissible chain of operator compositions (e.g., `CSI → MSP → MSC`). This prevents arbitrary or logically unsound evaluation pathways. For the complete specification of these rules, see `manual/29_Chain_Governance_and_Situational_Logic.md`.

## 0.1 The Foundational Stack

The framework is best understood as a sequential stack where each level emerges from the one below it.

### Level 0: The Substrate (`ρ_R`)

-   **Role:** Foundational Ground
-   **Description:** The foundational, homogeneous field of pure relational potential. It is pre-modal, continuous, and undifferentiated, containing no objects, relations, or dimensions but holding the latent tension that seeds all existence. For a full axiomatic specification, see [Section 00: The Relational Substrate](00_The_Relational_Substrate.md).

### Level 1: The Tri-Unity Engine (`δ–Φ–Π`)

-   **Role:** The Generative Engine
-   **Answers:** "How does anything begin?"
-   **Function:** The irreducible, three-part cycle that creates structure from the Substrate.
    1.  **`δ` (Deviation):** Detects a difference or fluctuation in the Substrate.
    2.  **`Φ` (Projection):** Maps the difference into a structured modal space.
    3.  **`Π` (Evaluation):** Tests the new structure for coherence and stability.
-   **Note:** This core engine is the universal process that drives all higher-level layers, emerging directly from the Substrate's dynamics. For its detailed emergence and specification, see [Section 00: The Relational Substrate](00_The_Relational_Substrate.md) and [Section 26: The Monistic Tri-Unity](26_The_Monistic_Tri-Unity.md).

### Level 2: Meta-Logical Governance & Computation

This layer comprises the primary operational components of the framework, which are emergent elaborations of the Tri-Unity cycle. For a detailed explanation of the causal flow between these layers, see `manual/23_MSP_MSC_MBC_Integration.md`.

#### Sub-Layer 2.1: MSP (Modal Symmetry Paradigm)

-   **Role:** Supreme Governor
-   **Answers:** "What distinctions are allowed to exist?"
-   **Function:** An elaboration of `δ` and `Φ`, MSP governs modal geometry and enforces universal symmetry laws.

#### Sub-Layer 2.2: MSC (Modal Structural Constraints)

-   **Role:** Admissibility Filter
-   **Answers:** "Is this a valid structure?"
-   **Function:** An elaboration of `Π`, MSC provides the "physics" of semantic objects, assessing their cohesion, integrity, and stability before they can be used in computation.

#### Sub-Layer 2.3: CRF & MBC (Computation)

-   **Role:** Execution Engine
-   **Answers:** "Given a valid structure, what can be computed?"
-   **Function:** The Constraint Resolution Framework (CRF) and Monistic Box Calculus (MBC) are the primary computational layers, using the stable structures validated by MSC to perform reasoning, inference, and other cognitive tasks.

### Level 3: Outputs

This layer represents the final products of the full-stack lifecycle.

#### Sub-Layer 3.1: I / N / U (Terminal States)

-   **Role:** Final Output
-   **Answers:** Provides the concluding state of a computation.
-   **Function:** `IS`, `NOT`, and `UNDETERMINED` represent the final, stable phase of a CRF evaluation.

#### Sub-Layer 3.2: Action Layer

-   **Role:** Agency and Influence
-   **Answers:** "What does this resolution cause?"
-   **Function:** Translates the final `I / N / U` state into behavior, decisions, and influence within a multi-agent environment. (See `manual/06_The_Action_Layer.md`).
