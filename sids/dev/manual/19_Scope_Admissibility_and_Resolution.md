# Manual Section 19: Scope, Admissibility, and Resolution

## 19.0 Preamble: The Nature of False Conflicts

A key strength of the framework is its ability to correctly handle not only true structural paradoxes but also *false conflicts*. A false conflict is an apparent contradiction that arises when an external observer attempts to compare concepts from different layers of the framework without respecting the rules of scope and admissibility that separate them.

This section explains the core principle that resolves these apparent inconsistencies and demonstrates the robustness of the framework's layered design.

## 19.1 The Principle of Scoped Admissibility

The foundational principle for resolving false conflicts is: **Scope constrains admissibility, not truth.**

-   **Truth** within the framework is a global property distributed across all its layers, from the foundational `Meta-Genesis` to the operational `CRF`.
-   **Admissibility**, however, is a local property strictly enforced by the **`MSC` (Modal Structural Constraints)** layer.

The `MSC` acts as a gatekeeper for the `CRF`, ensuring that the execution engine only ever receives a set of propositions and constraints that are coherent and belong to a single, valid scope for a given evaluation.

## 19.2 The Evaluator's Fallacy: Conflating Visibility with Availability

A false conflict arises from an error in meta-evaluation, here termed the "Evaluator's Fallacy."

-   **The Fallacy:** "If the CRF cannot see a resolution between two concepts, then the framework is contradictory or incomplete."

This is incorrect. The framework is designed to prevent the CRF from "seeing" information that is outside its admissible scope. For example, a deep ontological axiom from the `Meta-Genesis` layer may not be an admissible constraint for a high-level operational task within the CRF.

The CRF's inability to resolve a conflict between an admissible constraint and a non-admissible one is not a flaw. It is the *correct* behavior. The system is lawfully refusing to evaluate a query that violates its own rules of scope.

## 19.3 Resolution via Domain Lift

Apparent contradictions are not resolved by altering the CRF, but by performing a **domain lift**. The evaluator must move the analysis to a higher, more encompassing layer of the framework where both concepts are admissible and their relationship is formally defined.

-   **Example:** The apparent conflict between the `NOT Axiom → δ` hierarchy (operational) and the `Ψ → δ` hierarchy (ontological) is resolved by lifting the domain of analysis to the `Meta-Genesis` layer. There, the axioms show a clear, non-contradictory hierarchy: `NOT Axiom → δ → Ψ`, where `Ψ` (and its properties) are *emergent from* the dynamics of `δ`. The `Ψ → δ` relationship is revealed to be a context-specific calculational variant, not a foundational one.

## 19.4 Final Diagnosis of a False Conflict

When a conflict is suspected, the correct diagnostic procedure is:
1.  Identify the layers from which the conflicting concepts originate.
2.  Consult the `MSC` rules to determine if these concepts are mutually admissible for a single `CRF` evaluation.
3.  If they are not, the conflict is false. The `MSC` has already correctly resolved the issue by preventing an invalid evaluation.

The final diagnosis is not "Contradiction," but **"False Conflict due to Cross-Scope Comparison."** This outcome validates the framework's integrity, proving that it successfully prevents illicit resolution even when an observer expects one. The framework correctly refuses to answer questions it is not allowed to ask.
