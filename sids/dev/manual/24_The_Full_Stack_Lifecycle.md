# Manual Section 24: The Full Stack Lifecycle

## 24.0 Preamble

This document provides the canonical lifecycle model for the entire framework, detailing the literal processing pipeline from substrate to meaning, knowledge, and action. This "semantic metabolism" is the process by which minds reason, AI systems compute meaning, and semantic universes evolve.

The sequence is as follows:
`Substrate → Relational Dynamics → MSP → MSC → MBC → Knowledge → Action`

## 24.1 The Full Stack at a Glance

## 24.2 Stage 0: The Substrate (`ρ_R`)

The substrate is the homogeneous field of relational potential. It contains no objects, relations, or dimensions, but holds the latent tension that is the seed of all future meaning.

## 24.3 Stage 1: Relational Dynamics

The substrate is not inert; it experiences continuous fluctuations and proto-gradients. When this tension exceeds a minimum threshold (`∂ρ_R / ∂x > ε_min`), the system enters the MSP stage to handle the emerging difference.

## 24.4 Stage 2: MSP (Modal Symmetry Paradigm)

MSP is the layer that generates distinctions from the substrate's fluctuations. It uses three universal operators:
1.  **`δ` (Deviation):** The "spark" that breaks uniformity, creating a first point of semantic contrast.
2.  **`Φ` (Projection):** Assigns the deviation to a modal space (e.g., perceptual, conceptual), giving it coordinates.
3.  **`Π` (Evaluation):** Tests the new distinction for contextual validity and consistency.

The output of MSP is **proto-objects**: semantically distinguishable but not yet stable or persistent entities.

## 24.5 Stage 3: MSC (Modal Structural Cohesion)

MSC is the "physics" of semantic structure, determining whether the proto-objects from MSP will stabilize, dissolve, or fracture. It assesses four key properties:
1.  **Cohesion (`μ_s`):** Resistance to semantic change.
2.  **Connective Density (`ρ_c`):** The thickness of internal relational structure.
3.  **Integrity / Dignity (`D`):** Resistance to collapse under semantic pressure.
4.  **Modal Consistency (`Λ`):** The internal alignment of the object's modes.

If an object passes minimum thresholds for these properties, it emerges as a stable **Box**.

## 24.6 Stage 4: MBC (Monistic Box Calculus)

While MSC creates things that can *survive*, MBC creates things that can *compute*. It uses the stable Boxes from MSC in computational circuits. Its components include:
*   **Operators:** Functions that transform Boxes (amplify, route, integrate, etc.).
*   **Rewrite Systems:** Rules for normalization, error correction, and consistency enforcement.
*   **Interaction Tables:** Definitions of legal semantic combinations.
*   **Circuits:** Networks of Boxes that implement reasoning, inference, and cognition.

The output of MBC is **Semantic Computation**.

## 24.7 Stage 5: Knowledge

In this framework, Knowledge is the **stable, coherent output** of the MBC stage. It is what remains invariant after being processed by operators, rewrite rules, and cross-tier stability constraints. It is the converged, validated, and optimized semantic topology that survives the rigors of computation.

## 24.8 Stage 6: Action

Action is the agentic enactment of Knowledge. It is "knowledge expressed into the world," and includes:
*   **Cognitive Action:** Inference, planning, imagination.
*   **Behavioral Action:** Physical motion, speech, writing.
*   **Social Action:** Persuasion, cooperation, conflict.

## 24.9 System Feedback Loops

The lifecycle is not linear. It contains several crucial feedback loops that allow for learning and evolution:
*   **Action → MSP (Perception Loop):** Actions change the environment, creating new deviations for MSP to notice.
*   **MBC → MSC (Hardening Loop):** Computation can increase a Box's cohesion or cause it to fracture, altering its structural properties in MSC.
*   **MSC → MSP (Grounding Loop):** The existence of stable structures (identity) alters the evaluation thresholds in MSP. What you *are* changes what you *see*.
*   **Knowledge → MSP (Framing Loop):** The body of existing knowledge frames and filters new deviations, determining what is noticed and deemed relevant. Meaning creates further meaning.
