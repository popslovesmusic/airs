# Summary of Constraint Resolution Framework (CRF)

The 28 chapters of the Constraint Resolution Framework (CRF) manuscript outline a rigorous, constraint-based epistemology designed to replace "model-driven proliferation" with "resolution-driven inquiry."

## Core Themes

### 1. The Epistemic Crisis (Chapters 1–6)
*   **The Problem:** Modern knowledge systems are "unbounded." We can simulate and explain anything, leading to "cheap proliferation" where consensus and social reinforcement replace actual validation.
*   **The Pivot:** We must stop optimizing for **Explanation** (which is additive and hides contradictions) and start optimizing for **Resolution**.
*   **Pressure over Proof:** Claims earn validity not by being "proven" but by surviving orthogonal pressures (Logical, Mathematical, Structural, Computational, and Empirical).

### 2. The CRF Primitives (Chapters 7–10)
*   **Relational Substrate:** The foundational layer of all relations.
*   **Deviation ($\delta$):** The necessity of accounting for difference and error.
*   **Projection ($\Phi$):** Mapping structure without assuming substance.
*   **Evaluation ($\Pi$):** A rigorous filtering process where most weak claims are terminated.

### 3. Formal Mechanics & Calculus (Chapters 11–16)
*   **MSP & MSC:** Modal Symmetry Paradigm and Modal Structural Cohesion provide the rules for internal consistency.
*   **Monistic Box Calculus (MBC):** A formal system using **Operator Tiers (00–12)** to process claims mechanically.
*   **Phase Behavior:** Analyzing how the "state" of meaning changes under structural stress.

### 4. Implementation & AIRS (Chapters 17–24)
*   **Hostile Environments:** Simulation is used as a "hostile environment" to falsify ideas mathematically before they are ever executed.
*   **AIRS:** Named as the primary instrument for implementing CRF.
*   **Empirical Contact as Last Resort:** Physical testing should only occur after a claim has survived every other available structural pressure.
*   **SSOT:** The Single Source of Truth acts as the "Resolution Memory" to prevent narrative drift over time.

### 5. Boundaries & Termination (Chapters 25–28)
*   **The Ethics of Refusal:** CRF is defined by what it refuses to do—it rejects unbounded speculation and low-integrity claims.
*   **Termination:** Establishing clear principles for when a resolution process is complete.
*   **Survival:** The goal is not "total knowledge" but the identification of what survives the most extreme pressure. This survival is deemed "Enough."
