# Chapter 22: Empirical Contact (Last Resort)

In the scientific method, empirical observation is often the first step. In the Constraint Resolution Framework, it is the **last resort**. We only turn to the physical world when we have exhausted every other method of resolution.

### Why This is Expensive
Empirical contact is the most expensive operation in existence. It requires sensors, experiments, physical risks, and real-time data collection. In contrast, logical and mathematical resolution is cheap.
Therefore, CRF demands that we solve everything we *can* solve analytically before we ask the physical world for an answer. We do not use experiments to find questions; we use them to confirm answers that have already survived the gauntlet of Logic, Math, and Simulation.

### Why Most Claims Never Arrive Here
99% of claims should never reach the stage of empirical testing. They should die in the earlier stages:
*   Killed by Logic (Contradiction).
*   Killed by Math (Divergence).
*   Killed by Structure (Modal Closure).
*   Killed by Simulation (Instability).

If a claim survives all these kill switches, *then and only then* is it worthy of the resources required for empirical verification. This filter ensures that our experiments are high-value targeting, not random fishing expeditions.

### Data as Constraint, Not Confirmation
When we do collect data, we do not use it to "confirm" our theory. We use it as one final **Constraint**. 
The data points act as immovable objects in the simulation. If the model cannot flow around these data points without breaking its own internal logic, the model is dead. We do not tweak the model to fit the data (overfitting); we discard the model because it failed the reality test.

### Alignment vs. Explanation
At this final stage, we look for **Alignment**. Does the structural behavior of the model align with the observed behavior of the system? We are not looking for a narrative explanation ("Why did it happen?"). We are looking for structural isomorphism ("Did the pattern match?"). 
If the patterns align, the Box is stabilized. It becomes a **Fact**—not an eternal truth, but a structure that has survived every pressure the universe could throw at it.
