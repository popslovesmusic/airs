# Chapter 15: Operator Tiers (00–12)

Operations within the Monistic Box Calculus are organized into 13 hierarchical tiers. In most systems, tiers represent "power"—higher tiers can do more than lower ones. In the Constraint Resolution Framework, tiers represent **constraint**. A higher-tier operator is one that is subject to more global invariants and carries a heavier burden of resolution.

### The Constraint Hierarchy
Every operation in the system must be typed to a specific tier. This ensures that we always know the "causal depth" of a transformation. 

*   **Tier 00 (Primitives):** The root deviation operator (`D`). This is the only tier allowed to create difference without prior context.
*   **Tiers 01-03 (The Tri-Unity):** Operators for Deviation (`δ`), Projection (`Φ`), and Evaluation (`Π`). These are the workhorses of the framework.
*   **Tiers 04-08 (Local Dynamics):** Operators for weighting (`μ`), curvature (`λ`), and wave interactions (`ψ`). These manage the "physics" of how Boxes interact in local neighborhoods.
*   **Tiers 09-10 (Composites and Routing):** Operators for summation (`Σ`) and polarity/routing (`Θ`). These manage how small Boxes are folded into larger composites and how logic is routed through the network.
*   **Tier 11 (Evolution - χ):** Manages "semantic time." This tier models directed change and the flow of meaning. It is strictly constrained to prevent "narrative drift"—the tendency for ideas to change meaning over time without a formal re-evaluation.
*   **Tier 12 (Global Constraints - Ω):** The "Universal Refusal" layer. This tier enforces global consistency and normal forms across the entire system. `Ω` is the final check; if an operation violates a Tier 12 invariant, the entire transaction is rolled back.

### What an Operator Must Never Do
For each tier, CRF defines not just what it *can* do, but what it must **never** do. 
*   A Projection operator must never change the substance of the substrate.
*   A Summation operator must never ignore the individual constraints of its components.
*   An Evolution operator must never violate the invariants of the earlier tiers.

By explicitly defining the boundaries of each tier, we prevent "operational leakage." We ensure that the system cannot solve a Tier 09 problem by cheating with a Tier 01 operation. 

### Ω as the Kill Switch
Tier 12 (`Ω`) is the ultimate kill switch. It is the layer that says "No" when every other layer has said "Maybe." It is the implementation of the "Necessity of Refusal" described in Chapter 1. Without Tier 12, the system would eventually drift into the unbounded chaos of traditional knowledge models. Ω is the gravity that keeps the system centered on the substrate.
