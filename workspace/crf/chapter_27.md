# Chapter 27: What Survives

If the Constraint Resolution Framework is applied with full rigor, what is left? The answer is: **Very little**. And that is exactly the point. The purpose of CRF is not to maximize the volume of our knowledge, but to maximize its density.

### Very Little
In an unbounded system, we are accustomed to having an opinion on everything. CRF strips this away. After the gauntlet of Logic, Math, Simulation, and Empirical Constraint, most claims lie in ruins. The few that survive are not a sprawling city of explanations, but a small, hardened outpost of resolutions. 
This scarcity is a feature. It means that everything we *do* retain is load-bearing. We trade the illusion of omniscience for the reality of competence.

### Temporarily
Nothing survives forever. A Box in the SSOT is not an eternal monument; it is a temporary shelter. It survives only as long as the current set of constraints remains the best available. 
We accept that our "facts" are merely the current champions of the arena. They will eventually be defeated by better measurements or tighter logic. When they fall, we do not mourn them; we celebrate the upgrade.

### Locally
The dream of Universal Truth—laws that apply everywhere, always, and to everything—is largely a relic of theological thinking. In CRF, most surviving structures are **Local**. 
*   They are true within a specific Causal Sphere of Influence (CSI).
*   They are true within a specific Modal Frame.
*   They are true under specific boundary conditions.

Accepting the locality of knowledge allows us to be precise. We stop trying to stretch local truths into universal laws (which causes them to snap) and instead build a patchwork of overlapping, high-integrity local maps.

### Under Stated Constraints
Finally, what survives is always conditional. A claim never stands naked; it is always clothed in its constraints. "X is true" is an illegal statement in CRF. The legal statement is: "X is resolved under Constraints {A, B, C}."
This explicit dependency means that if Constraint A changes, we know exactly which claims need to be re-tested. We maintain a live graph of dependency, not a static pile of beliefs.
