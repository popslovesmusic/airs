# Chapter 24: Revision Without Narrative Drift

When new information forces a change in the model, the system must update. However, in unbounded systems, this update often takes the form of **Narrative Drift**. We subtly rewrite our memory of the past to make it consistent with the present. "We always knew X," we say, when in fact we believed Y.

CRF strictly forbids narrative drift. It enforces a discipline of **Explicit Revision**.

### How Claims Evolve
When a claim in the SSOT is challenged by a new valid constraint, it is not "corrected"; it is **Revoked** and **Replaced**. 
*   **Revocation:** The old Box is marked `DEPRECATED`. It is not deleted; it remains in the archive as a record of what we used to believe.
*   **Replacement:** A new Box is generated with the new structure.

This creates a clear "diff" of our understanding. We can see exactly when and why we changed our mind. This prevents the "gaslighting" effect of shifting narratives.

### How Constraints Tighten
Ideally, revisions should be driven by the **tightening of constraints**. As our resolution tools get better (e.g., more precise sensors, better algorithms), the allowable error bars shrink. A Box that was stable under "Version 1.0" constraints might collapse under "Version 2.0."
This is progress. We want our ideas to die as our standards rise. A system where old ideas never die is a system that has stopped evolving.

### Replacing Tools
Just as claims are replaced, the tools of resolution (the Operator Tiers and AIRS algorithms) must also be subject to revision. If a tool is found to be systematically biased or structurally flawed, it is retired.
When a tool is retired, every claim that was resolved using that tool is flagged for **Re-Evaluation**. This is expensive but necessary. It ensures that our knowledge base is not corrupted by the legacy of bad instruments.

### No Retroactive Justification
The cardinal sin of revision is **Retroactive Justification**. This occurs when we decide we want to keep a claim, so we invent a new constraint to justify it after the old justification failed. 
CRF blocks this via the "Directionality of Logic." Constraints must precede the claim. You cannot invent a rule to save a specific player; the rules must be blind to the outcome. If a claim falls, let it fall. Do not catch it with a lie.
