# Chapter 11: Modal Symmetry Paradigm (MSP)

With the Monistic Tri-Unity (δ–Φ–Π) established as the engine of creation and selection, we must now define the environment in which this engine operates. This environment is the **Modal Symmetry Paradigm (MSP)**. If the Tri-Unity is the "physics" of the system, MSP is the "geometry." It establishes the fundamental axes of distinction and the invariant rules that all structures must obey.

### Symmetry Precedes Content
A core tenet of the Constraint Resolution Framework is that **symmetry precedes content**. Before we can know *what* a thing is, we must know the symmetries of the space it occupies. 

MSP enforces a "symmetry-first" approach. We do not ask "What is the value of X?" until we have established "What are the valid transformations of X?" This prevents category errors where we attempt to compare or combine objects that exist in fundamentally incompatible modal frames.

### Modal Closure
One of the primary invariants of MSP is **Modal Closure**. This rule states that operations within a specific mode (e.g., Logic, Causality, Ethics) must resolve within that mode. You cannot use an ethical argument to solve a mathematical equation, nor a theological argument to patch a hole in a causal chain.

"Leaking" between modes is a primary source of systemic error. Unbounded systems often solve difficult problems by jumping to a different mode (e.g., "God of the gaps" arguments or using "political necessity" to justify "economic truth"). MSP explicitly forbids this. If a problem cannot be resolved within its native mode, it must be marked as `UNRESOLVED`, not patched with foreign material.

### Non-Forcing
The principle of **Non-Forcing** dictates that we cannot compel a resolution where the structural support does not exist. We cannot "force" a `TRUE` or `FALSE` verdict if the underlying substrate does not support the distinction. 

Violating Non-Forcing leads to "brittle" knowledge—claims that look solid but shatter under the slightest stress. MSP requires us to accept the limits of our current resolution. It is better to have a hole in the map than a false island.

### Root-Level Hygiene
MSP acts as the "root-level hygiene" for the entire framework. It filters out ill-formed questions and invalid operations before they ever reach the evaluation stage. By strictly enforcing symmetry and closure, MSP ensures that the Tri-Unity only expends energy on problems that are actually well-posed.
