# Core Command Center Terms

**Symbolics Sandbox** – The Stage 2 workspace that blends SymPy-backed
expression authoring with mission parameter context. It provides
simplification, differentiation, integration, and numeric evaluation
modes.

**Session Capsule** – A persisted mission snapshot combining the current
symbolic expression, mission inputs, and collaborator roster so teams can
replay investigations.

**Collaboration Shelf** – The interface surface inside the playground
that lists saved sessions and shared notes in chronological order.

**Stage 2 Review Gate** – The stability and comprehension assessment
required before the project transitions to ML acceleration activities.
