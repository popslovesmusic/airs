# Stage 2 Playground Readiness Checklist

With the symbolic sandbox, tutorial navigator, and collaboration shelf
now integrated, the Command Center must pause for the Stage 2 review
gate. The objectives for this checkpoint are:

- Validate the stability of the SymPy evaluation pipeline and ensure
  sandbox errors are clearly communicated to reviewers.
- Confirm that reviewers can complete the ``Command Center Playground:
  Getting Started`` walkthrough while consulting the glossary inline.
- Exercise the session persistence workflow by saving a mission,
  sharing notes, and recovering the capsule in a fresh browser session.
- Capture any performance observations when issuing repeated symbolic
  evaluations or syncing shared notes.

Document findings and sign-off results in this file before scheduling
ML acceleration work.
