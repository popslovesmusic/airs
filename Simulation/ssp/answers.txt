Short answer first, then the implications.

---

## 1. Are SSPs and Mixer always created from the same configuration path that guarantees identical `field_len`?

**They must be — but only if the architecture invariant is enforced.**

Conceptually:

* **SSPs** define *how a field is represented* (dimensionality, basis, indexing).
* **Mixer** defines *how multiple SSP fields are combined* (weights, masks, couplings).

If they are instantiated from **separate config paths**, identical `field_len` becomes an *assumption*, not a guarantee.

### Required invariant (architectural)

```json5
{
  "invariant": "SSP.field_len == Mixer.field_len",
  "enforcement": "single_authoritative_config",
  "failure_mode": "silent misalignment or spectral leakage"
}
```

### Best practice

* `field_len` must be **declared once**, upstream.
* SSPs and Mixer should *consume*, not *define*, it.
* Any local override is a **hard error**, not a warning.

If your current code *relies on convention* instead of a shared config object / constructor contract, then no — it is **not guaranteed**, and that is a latent bug.

---

## 2. Should `alpha` and masks be unitless fractions, or is mass-scaled formulation intentional?

This depends on **what layer they belong to**.

### Rule of thumb

> **Mixing coefficients are unitless. Physics enters elsewhere.**

### Case breakdown

#### ✅ Unitless (recommended for Mixer / SSP coupling)

* `alpha`, masks ∈ [0,1]
* Represent **relative contribution**, **gating**, or **attention**
* Independent of physical interpretation

```json5
{
  "alpha": { "type": "float", "units": "dimensionless", "domain": [0,1] },
  "mask":  { "type": "float[]", "units": "dimensionless" }
}
```

This keeps:

* Linear algebra clean
* Normalization stable
* Mixer reusable across domains

#### ⚠️ Mass-scaled (only valid if explicit)

Mass-scaled alphas are valid **only if**:

* The Mixer is *not* a generic combiner
* You are encoding **physical coupling strength** directly
* Units are tracked and conserved

```json5
{
  "alpha": {
    "type": "float",
    "units": "kg | energy-equivalent",
    "role": "physical coupling coefficient"
  }
}
```

This must be:

* Explicit in naming (`alpha_mass`, `g_coupling`)
* Isolated from normalization logic
* Never mixed with unitless masks

---

## Bottom line

### Configuration path

* **Yes**, SSPs and Mixer should always be created from the **same authoritative config** for `field_len`
* If not enforced, you are relying on fragile symmetry

### Alpha & masks

* **Default:** unitless fractions
* **Mass-scaled:** only intentional if the Mixer itself is a physical operator, not a signal combiner

---

### Minimal governance check (recommended)

```json5
{
  "checks": [
    "SSP.field_len === Mixer.field_len",
    "alpha.units === 'dimensionless'",
    "mask.units === 'dimensionless'"
  ],
  "on_failure": "abort_initialization"
}
```

If you want, next we can:

* Audit your current instantiation paths for hidden divergence
* Split “physical coupling” from “mixing” cleanly
* Formalize this as a Governor invariant or constructor contract
