Below are **engineering-grade artifacts**, not philosophy.
They are written so a software engineer can tape them to the wall and not break SID by accident.

No metaphors. No prose drift.

# 1. SID **DON’TS LIST**

**Things an engineer must never try**

These are **hard violations**, not style preferences.

---

## A. Architectural Don’ts (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Do not allow any SSP to read another SSP’s field**

   * No debug peeks
   * No logging shortcuts
   * No “temporary inspection”
   * If you need comparison, the **Mixer** does it

2. **Do not let the Mixer write directly to I or N**

   * Ever
   * Not even “for initialization”
   * Not even “to fix conservation”

3. **Do not allow I or N to mutate after creation**

   * No decay
   * No overwrite
   * No “rebalancing”
   * If content must change, it happens via **Transport**, not mutation

4. **Do not bypass SSP(U) for collapse**

   * Collapse must execute *inside* SSP(U)
   * Mixer issues directives only
   * Engines never collapse themselves

5. **Do not let engines communicate**

   * No shared buffers
   * No cross-engine callbacks
   * No shared globals

---

## B. Semantic Don’ts (These break meaning)

6. **Do not numerically blend semantic fields**

   * No averaging I/N/U
   * No weighted sums across processors
   * No “soft merge”

7. **Do not treat masks as probabilities**

   * Masks are *eligibility*, not likelihood
   * Sampling semantics will destroy conservation

8. **Do not re-inflate U**

   * No code path may increase U
   * No “reconsideration”
   * No “undo collapse”

9. **Do not flip polarity**

   * I → N is forbidden
   * N → I is forbidden
   * Only U → {I,N} exists

10. **Do not emit Transport while collapse is ongoing**

    * Transport is a **phase transition**
    * Not a streaming event

---

## C. Governance / Layering Don’ts

11. **Do not embed policy in engines**

    * Engines have physics, not semantics
    * No admissibility logic in engines

12. **Do not let DASE or AIRS bypass SID**

    * They may schedule
    * They may observe
    * They may never mutate semantic state

13. **Do not make collapse reversible “for experimentation”**

    * That creates a different system
    * If you want reversibility, design a new layer

---

# 2. SID **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

**Tests that must pass before the system is considered correct**

These are binary pass/fail.
If any fail → system is invalid.

---

## A. Structural Tests

☐ SSP roles are immutable after creation
☐ Exactly 3 SSPs exist (I, N, U)
☐ Each SSP hosts exactly one engine
☐ No engine has access to another engine’s memory
☐ Mixer has no write access to SSP(I/N) fields

---

## B. Conservation Tests

☐ For all timesteps `t`:

```
|I(t) + N(t) + U(t) − C| ≤ ε
```

☐ `U(t+1) ≤ U(t)` for all t
☐ `I(t+1) ≥ I(t)` for all t
☐ `N(t+1) ≥ N(t)` for all t

☐ Conservation holds across collapse
☐ Conservation holds across Transport

---

## C. Collapse Semantics Tests

☐ Collapse only mutates SSP(U)
☐ Collapse reduces U strictly when mask > 0
☐ Collapsed mass is never returned to U
☐ `M_I + M_N ≤ 1` holds element-wise
☐ Zero mask produces zero change

---

## D. Mixer Logic Tests

☐ Mixer never averages fields
☐ Mixer decisions are predicate-based
☐ loop_gain converges under stable dynamics
☐ conservation_error trends to 0 under stable dynamics

---

## E. Transport Tests

☐ Transport emits only after K stable steps
☐ Transport never mutates SSP fields
☐ Transport is idempotent per phase
☐ Transport does not re-open U

---

## F. Negative Tests (Must Fail)

☐ Attempted I → U mutation is rejected
☐ Attempted N → U mutation is rejected
☐ Attempted cross-SSP read causes fault
☐ Attempted engine-engine coupling causes fault

# 3. SID **FAILURE-MODE MATRIX**

This is what *goes wrong*, how to detect it, and how to respond.

---

## A. Semantic Failures

| Failure             | Symptom               | Detection               | Correct Response          |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Premature collapse  | U drains too fast     | spike in collapse_ratio | reduce α or tighten masks |
| Collapse starvation | U never drains        | flat collapse_ratio     | loosen admissibility      |
| Semantic thrashing  | I oscillates          | high loop_gain          | add hysteresis            |
| Mask saturation     | U collapses uniformly | mask_saturation → 1     | cap mask density          |

---

## B. Conservation Failures

| Failure       | Symptom           | Detection              | Response         |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Mass leak     | I+N+U < C         | conservation_error > ε | halt + log       |
| Mass creation | I+N+U > C         | conservation_error > ε | halt + log       |
| Numeric drift | slow error growth | monotonic error        | renormalize once |

---

## C. Architectural Failures

| Failure                 | Symptom               | Detection             | Response |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| Cross-visibility        | correlated SSP fields | debug instrumentation | abort    |
| Engine writes wrong SSP | unexpected mutation   | write audit           | abort    |
| Mixer mutation          | I/N changed           | hash mismatch         | abort    |

---

## D. Transport Failures

| Failure           | Symptom           | Detection      | Response         |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Early transport   | unresolved U      | U > threshold  | suppress         |
| Transport flicker | repeated T events | rapid toggling | add hysteresis   |
| Deadlock          | U≈0 but unstable  | loop_gain high | force diagnostic |

---

## E. Policy Failures (Expected, Not Fatal)

| Failure          | Symptom             | Meaning                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| High N growth    | many exclusions     | system is learning constraints |
| Slow convergence | long stabilization  | ambiguity is real              |
| Persistent U     | undecidable content | acceptable outcome             |

These are **not bugs**.

## One-Line Summary (Engineer-Facing)

> **If you preserve isolation, enforce irreversibility, and never violate conservation, SID will behave correctly even if everything else is naïve.**
