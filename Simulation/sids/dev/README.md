# Development Files

This directory contains working files, notes, and drafts that are not part of the core SID implementation.

## Structure

### `/drafts/`
Alternate implementations, schemas, and draft tools:
- `demo.py` - Interactive demo (use `demo_auto.py` in root instead)
- `sid_package.example.json` - Alternate package example
- `sid_package.schema.json` - Draft JSON schema
- `sid_schema.json` - Alternate schema

### `/notes/`
Working notes and documentation:
- `diagrams.txt` - Diagram sketches and notes
- `philosophical_essays.md` - Conceptual essays
- `semantic_interaction_diagrams_refined_notes.md` - Refined notes

### `/manual/`
Extended manual chapters (51 files):
- Detailed theoretical framework documentation

## Usage

These files are preserved for reference and historical context but are not required for the core SID framework functionality.

For the production implementation, see the files in the project root.
