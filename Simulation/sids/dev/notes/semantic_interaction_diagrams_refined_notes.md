# Semantic Interaction Diagrams (SIDs)

## 0. Purpose and Scope

These notes define a **structural framework for agency, meaning, and goal emergence** that does *not* assume goals, optimization, time, psychology, or symbolic semantics. The framework is diagrammatic, constraint‑governed, and non‑teleological. Goals and agency arise as **structural consequences**, not inputs.

The framework is intended to be:
- structurally minimal
- procedurally governed
- diagrammatically computable
- compatible with mathematics without being defined by it

## 1. Structural Foundations (Pre‑Math)

### 1.1 Degrees of Freedom

Assume only:
- distinctions exist
- constraints exist
- change is possible

From this follow **degrees of freedom (DOF)**. DOFs may be independent (orthogonal) or coupled.

### 1.2 Orthogonality of Causation

Two fundamental causal domains are distinguished:

- **Horizontal causation**: diachronic, temporal succession
- **Vertical causation**: synchronic, hierarchical dependence

These domains are **orthogonal**. Mixing them produces category errors. Neither is primary.

### 1.3 Possibility Space

Orthogonal DOFs span a **possibility space**. This space is not metric, probabilistic, or goal‑oriented. It is simply the domain of what is *admissible*.

---

## 2. CSI — Causal Sphere of Influence

### 2.1 Definition

**CSI** defines the boundary of admissible interaction at a given scale or context.

- Inside CSI → interaction is possible
- Outside CSI → interaction is forbidden or irrelevant

CSI is **not temporal**, **not spatial**, and **not dynamic by default**.

### 2.2 Role

CSI functions as a **hard gate**:
- it constrains which operators may interact
- it limits which diagrams may be drawn
- it bounds resolution scope

CSI precedes diagrams and CRF.

## 3. I / N / U Logic

### 3.1 Definition

I/N/U is a **classification logic**, not an inferential one:

- **I (Is)** — admissible, coherent, affirmed
- **N (Not)** — excluded, forbidden, contradictory
- **U (Unknown)** — unresolved, undecidable, open

### 3.2 Role

I/N/U labels the **epistemic status** of constraints, relations, or diagram elements *at the current stage*.

It does not:
- infer truth
- resolve conflict
- choose outcomes

### 3.3 Placement

I/N/U sits **between diagrams and CRF** as a typing layer.

---

## 4. Primitive Operators

Operators act on semantic space but do not encode meaning.

### 4.1 Minimal Operator Set

- **Projection (P)** — isolate a DOF
- **Polarity (S±)** — stance / affirmation / negation
- **Collapse (O)** — irreversible commitment / loss of freedom
- **Coupling (C)** — relational constraint between DOFs
- **Transport (T)** — movement across compartments

These operators are composable and non‑teleological.

## 5. Semantic Interaction Diagrams (SIDs)

### 5.1 Definition

A **Semantic Interaction Diagram** is a composed expression of operators representing local interactions in semantic space.

Diagrams are:
- calculational, not illustrative
- local, not global
- rewriteable

### 5.2 Core Loop

The fundamental SID pattern is:

**Freedom → Choice (Collapse) → Gradient → Freedom**

This loop underlies agency, deliberation, and stabilization.

### 5.3 Compartments

Diagrams operate within **logarithmic compartments**:
- each compartment compresses history
- transitions are irreversible
- memory is structural, not stored

This yields **non‑Markovian behavior without memory variables**.

---

## 6. Rewrite & Equivalence Rules

### 6.1 Rewrite Rules

Rewrite rules specify how diagrams may be transformed without changing structural effect.

### 6.2 Equivalence

Two diagrams are equivalent iff:
- they preserve admissibility
- they preserve collapse irreversibility
- they yield the same post‑compartment constraints

Equivalence is **conditional**, not universal.

---

## 7. CRF — Constraint Resolution Framework

### 7.1 Nature

CRF is a **procedural language**, not an operator, not a metric, and not part of semantic space.

### 7.2 Role

CRF governs:
- admissibility of diagrams
- authorization of rewrites
- timing and legality of collapse
- handling of unresolved conflict

CRF never chooses outcomes.

### 7.3 Mechanics

CRF operates via:
- constraint typing (hard / soft, local / global)
- admissibility checks
- ordered resolution procedures (attenuate, defer, partition, escalate, bifurcate, halt)
- explicit failure semantics

CRF enables **human discourse using familiar terms** without semantic smuggling.

## 8. Metrics (Earned, Not Assumed)

Metrics may be extracted *only after* structure stabilizes.

Examples:
- admissible volume
- collapse ratio
- gradient coherence
- transport fidelity
- loop gain

Metrics are downstream and optional.

---

## 9. Structural Stability / Termination

A semantic process is **structurally stable** when:

- no admissible rewrites remain, or
- admissible region is invariant under transport, or
- CRF authorizes only identity rewrites, or
- loop gain converges within tolerance

At stability, a **goal has emerged** as a fixed attractor — without being defined.

---

## 10. Minimal Core (Irreducible)

The system cannot function without:

- orthogonal DOFs
- CSI admissibility boundary
- I/N/U epistemic typing
- operators {P, S, O, C, T}
- SIDs with rewrite rules
- CRF procedural governance

Everything else is optional or downstream.

---

## 11. Interpretation (Last)

Only after stability may the system be interpreted as:
- agency
- goals
- cognition
- policy

Interpretation has **no upstream authority**.

---

## One‑Sentence Summary

This framework models agency and goal emergence as the structural outcome of constraint‑governed semantic interaction, using diagrams, procedural resolution, and earned measurement — without assuming goals, optimization, or cognition.
