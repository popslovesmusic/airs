Missing SID rewrite fixtures (Step 5a)
====================================

What we need
------------
- Initial diagram(s) D0 for SID ternary/SSP rewrites.
- Corresponding rewrite rule sets R (JSON or CLI-friendly) that can be applied via sid_cli/dase_cli.
- Engine params P (node count/capacity, role, any knobs needed).
- Horizon cap for each scenario (max steps before declaring non-termination).

Why needed
----------
The Step 5a harness is ready to run multiple rewrite scheduling policies and compare canonical witnesses, but it cannot proceed without concrete fixtures:
- No diagram -> no admissible rewrites to exercise.
- No rule set -> policies P1..P5 have nothing to schedule.
- No params -> cannot instantiate engines consistently.

Proposed minimal fixture set (to unblock)
-----------------------------------------
1) Tiny deterministic diagram (e.g., 6–12 nodes) with 2–3 non-overlapping rewrite rules that commute.
2) A slightly larger diagram with overlapping matches to expose ordering effects.
3) A cycle-prone diagram to validate termination/cycle detection.

Format expectation (preferred)
------------------------------
- JSONL for runner/CLI: commands create_engine, sid_set_diagram_json (or expr), sid_rewrite / un_steps with rewrite triggers.
- Rules: JSON array of rewrite patterns and replacements, each with stable IDs.
- Optionally a horizon_cap field per scenario.

Next steps once fixtures are provided
-------------------------------------
- Implement policy drivers P1..P5 inside harness (or CLI wrapper) using seeded scheduling.
- Compute canonical witness (canon hash + invariants vector {mass_I, mass_N, mass_U, total_mass, node_count, edge_count}).
- Add per-scenario tests asserting witness equality across policies and seeds.

Status
------
- Harness file added: Simulation/tests/harness/harness_sid_rewrite.cpp (currently skipped).
- Build/test pass: ctest -C Debug -L harness.

Please drop the fixtures/rules at the root (or point me to existing ones), and I’ll wire them in immediately.
