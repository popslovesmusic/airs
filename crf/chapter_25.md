# Chapter 25: What CRF Refuses to Do

The final test of any framework is its ability to stop. A framework that claims to solve everything is not a discipline; it is a fantasy. The Constraint Resolution Framework is defined by its **Refusals**. 

### No Ultimate Ontology
CRF does not seek to provide an ultimate description of "what the world is." It refuses to engage in the debate over realism vs. idealism, or any other metaphysical binary. It provides a mechanism for resolving *claims* about the world, but it remains agnostic about the underlying nature of that world beyond the minimal requirement of the Relational Substrate. We do not offer the "Truth"; we offer the "Least Unstable Structure."

### No Cosmic Explanation
CRF refuses to provide "meaning" in the existential or emotional sense. It does not explain the "why" of the universe. It is a machine for processing information, not a philosophy for living. While it can resolve a causal chain, it cannot provide a purpose for that chain. We leave the search for cosmic meaning to other, less constrained modes of thought.

### No Metaphysical Closure
There is no "End of Science" or "Final Theory" in CRF. The framework explicitly rejects the idea of metaphysical closure—the point where all questions are answered and the model is complete. 
Because the substrate is of infinite potential and our constraints are always being refined, the process of resolution is necessarily infinite. There will always be a deviation that has not yet been projected, or a projection that has not yet been evaluated. We accept the "Open Horizon" of inquiry.

### No Total Synthesis
CRF refuses the "Hegelian Temptation"—the urge to synthesize every conflict into a higher unity. As stated in Part II, many conflicts are resolved by **elimination**, not synthesis. 
We do not aim for a single, monolithic Model of Everything. We aim for a sparse, high-integrity network of load-bearing facts. If two parts of the system cannot be linked without violating a Tier 12 invariant, we leave them unlinked. We prefer a honest fracture to a forced connection.
