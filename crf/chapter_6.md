# Chapter 2: Claims as Epistemic Liabilities

In standard discourse, a claim is often treated as an asset—a potential unit of truth to be hoarded until proven otherwise. The Constraint Resolution Framework (CRF) inverts this relationship. Within a rigorous resolution system, every claim is an **epistemic liability**. It is a demand on system resources, a source of potential noise, and a structural vulnerability waiting to be exploited.

### Fragility and the Burden of Survival
The traditional "burden of proof" places the onus on the claimant to demonstrate validity. However, in practice, this often degenerates into a "burden of disproof" for the skeptic, allowing weak claims to survive simply because refuting them is exhaustive or technically difficult.

CRF shifts this to a **burden of survival**. A claim is not assumed to be "neutral" until validated; it is assumed to be **fragile**. It must actively withstand immediate, high-pressure constraint testing to earn the right to exist within the workspace. If a claim cannot support its own structural weight without external propping (social consensus, vague definitions, or ad hoc hypotheses), it is discarded immediately. We do not ask "Is this true?" but "Can this survive?"

### Longevity is Not Evidence
A common fallacy in unbounded systems is the conflation of longevity with validity. The fact that a theory or model has persisted for decades is often cited as evidence of its robustness. In reality, longevity often signals the opposite: **non-falsifiability**.

A claim that survives because it is too vague to be pinned down, or because it shifts its parameters whenever challenged, is a parasite on the epistemic ecosystem. It persists not because it is structurally sound, but because it lacks the "surface area" required for rigorous impact. In the CRF, the inability to be efficiently terminated is a defect, not a virtue.

### The Danger of "Not Yet Falsified"
The most dangerous category of claims is not the demonstrably false, but the "not yet falsified." These are the zombie states of knowledge—propositions that linger in the "Undetermined" space without ever forcing a resolution. They accumulate "interest" in the form of wasted attention and computational cycles.

Treating "not yet falsified" as a provisional form of truth is a systemic error. It encourages the hoarding of low-quality models under the guise of open-mindedness. A healthy resolution system must have a mechanism for **probation**: a strict time limit or resource cap on how long a claim can remain undetermined before it is revoked.

### Managing the Liability
If claims are liabilities, they must be managed with the same rigor as financial debts. We must ask:
1.  **What is the cost of maintaining this claim?** (How much subsequent logic depends on it?)
2.  **What is its payoff?** (Does it resolve a contradiction or merely displace it?)
3.  **Is it solvent?** (Can it pay its own structural way, or does it require constant apologetics?)

A system that cannot bankrupt its bad ideas—that lets claims live too long out of sentiment or inertia—will eventually collapse under the weight of its own unresolved liabilities. The purpose of CRF is to provide the bankruptcy proceedings for these epistemic debts.
