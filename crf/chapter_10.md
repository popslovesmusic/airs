# Chapter 10: Evaluation (Π): Where Most Ideas Die

The final step of the Monistic Tri-Unity is **Evaluation (Π)**. This is the "immune system" of the Constraint Resolution Framework. Its function is not to admire the structure created by Projection (Φ), but to attack it. Evaluation is the machinery of rejection.

### The Primacy of Rejection
In many knowledge systems, evaluation is treated as a form of validation—a way to "prove" that an idea is good. In CRF, the polarity is reversed. The default state of any new projection is "Invalid." Evaluation is the process of attempting to destroy the projection using the pressures described in Part II.

If a projection collapses under stress, the system has successfully performed its function. It has prevented a weak structure from occupying resources. Rejection is not a failure of the system; it is a successful resolution of noise. Π dominates δ and Φ because it is the gatekeeper of reality. Deviation and Projection are merely proposals; Evaluation is the verdict.

### Evaluation ≠ Judgment
It is important to distinguish Evaluation from "judgment." Judgment implies a subjective, often moral, assessment of value. Evaluation is a mechanical stress test. It is like testing a bridge: we load it with weight until it either holds or cracks. 

We do not "judge" the bridge for cracking; we simply observe that its structural integrity (μ_s) was insufficient for the applied load. This mechanical detachment allows us to ruthlessly eliminate weak ideas without emotional attachment. We are not killing "our" ideas; we are simply observing that a specific structure failed a specific test.

### The Feedback Loop
Evaluation is not the end of the line. It is the closing of the loop.
1.  **If a structure fails:** It is dissolved, clearing the workspace for a new attempt.
2.  **If a structure holds:** It is not "proven true" forever. It is provisionally stabilized. It earns the right to be used as a component in larger structures (the "Boxes" of the Monistic Box Calculus).

However, even stabilized structures remain subject to Π. As the system evolves and new constraints (Ω) are discovered, old structures may be re-evaluated and retroactively collapsed. In CRF, nothing is safe from the question: "Does this still hold?"
