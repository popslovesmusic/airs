# Chapter 13: Phase Behavior of Meaning

To manage the stability of knowledge, we must understand its thermodynamics. Meaning is not a static property; it exhibits **Phase Behavior**. Depending on the "temperature" (ambiguity/noise) and "pressure" (constraint/urgency) of the system, a set of claims can exist in distinct phases: Gas, Liquid, Solid, or Crystal.

### The Phases
*   **Gas (Noise/Chaos):** High entropy, low cohesion. Ideas float freely with little interaction. There is no structure, but maximal potential. This is the state of "brainstorming" or raw data collection.
*   **Liquid (Narrative/Flow):** Moderate entropy, moderate cohesion. Ideas link together in chains but do not hold a fixed shape. They flow to fill the container of the current context. This is the state of storytelling or provisional hypothesis.
*   **Solid (Knowledge/Structure):** Low entropy, high cohesion. Structures are rigid and load-bearing. You can build on top of them. This is the state of established fact or rigorous theory.
*   **Crystal (Dogma/axiom):** Minimal entropy, infinite rigidity. The structure is locked in a repeating pattern. It is incredibly strong but brittle. It cannot adapt; it can only persist or shatter.

### Phase Transitions as Failure Modes
The most dangerous moments in a knowledge system are the **Phase Transitions**. 
*   **Sublimation (Solid → Gas):** A trusted fact suddenly evaporates under new scrutiny. This causes panic and structural collapse.
*   **Freezing (Liquid → Solid):** A premature hardening of a narrative into a fact before it has been properly tested. This locks in errors.
*   **Vitrification (Liquid → Glass):** When a system cools too fast without crystallizing, it becomes a disordered solid (glass). It looks stable but is under immense internal tension and will shatter unpredictably.

### Rigidity is Not Strength
A common error is to mistake rigidity (Crystal phase) for strength (Solid phase). A diamond is harder than steel, but you cannot build a skyscraper out of it because it cannot flex. 
A healthy resolution system aims for the **Solid Phase**: structured enough to bear weight, but possessing enough internal degrees of freedom (ductility) to absorb the tremors of new information without collapsing.

### Entropy as Default
The Second Law of Thermodynamics applies here: the natural tendency of any semantic system is toward the Gas phase (entropy). Keeping knowledge in the Solid phase requires constant work—"Semantic Work"—to repair structural fatigue and re-integrate loose connections. Without this active maintenance, all knowledge eventually decays into noise.
