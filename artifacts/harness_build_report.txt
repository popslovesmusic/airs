Harness Build Report (2026-01-22)
=================================

What changed
------------
- Added CMake option BUILD_HARNESS and integrated GoogleTest-based harness target harness_tests with policy/metrics support.
- Implemented policy loader and helpers:
  * Simulation/tests/harness/harness_policy.{hpp,cpp}
  * Simulation/tests/harness/harness_test_util.{hpp,cpp}
  * harness_main.cpp and harness_example.cpp as entry and smoke tests.
- Metrics archive directories created at repo root: metrics/<engine_family>/.
- CMake now auto-fetches GoogleTest if missing; also supports using a pre-extracted source dir.
- Enabled CTest when BUILD_TESTS=ON; labels applied to harness tests.

What’s needed next
------------------
- Expand harness_example.cpp into real engine suites per validation table.
- Add fixtures under Simulation/tests/fixtures/ and golden outputs in artifacts/validation/.
- Wire reporting JSON + metrics for each engine suite.
- Update Simulation/tests/README.md and scripts/run_harness.ps1 to document commands and metrics layout.

Usage (current build)
---------------------
Configure (reusing downloaded GTest):
  cmake -S Simulation -B build -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_HARNESS=ON -DUSE_GTEST=ON \ 
        -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_GOOGLETEST=D:/airs/build/_deps/googletest-src/googletest-1.14.0 \ 
        -DFETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED=ON

Build:
  cmake --build build --target harness_tests

Run tests (VS generator):
  cd build && ctest -C Debug -L harness

Artifacts/paths
---------------
- Binary: build/Debug/harness_tests.exe
- Metrics: metrics/<engine_family>/ (pre-created)
- Validation policy source: validation table.txt
- Harness sources: Simulation/tests/harness/

Notes
-----
- If using a different generator (e.g., Ninja), drop the -C Debug when running ctest.
- FetchContent download already completed; no further network needed unless _deps is cleaned.
