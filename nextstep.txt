🔹 Immediate next step — Run Phase 5a-A (CLI only)
For each rewrite policy:

Load params.json

Load diagram.json

Load rules.json

Execute rewrites until termination

Save:

final diagram

invariant totals

step count

Conceptually (names may vary):

bash
Copy code
sid_cli create_engine params.json
sid_cli load_diagram diagram.json
sid_cli load_rules rules.json
sid_cli rewrite --policy P1 --dump final_P1.json
sid_cli rewrite --policy P2 --dump final_P2.json
...
At this stage:

do not canonicalize yet

just confirm termination + conservation across policies

🔹 After that — Phase 5a-C (Hybrid adjudication)
Then (and only then):

feed each final_*.json into the C++ canonicalizer

compute witnesses

compare witnesses across policies

That comparison produces the actual Step 5a PASS / FAIL.

Why this matters (big picture, one sentence)
With this scenario, you are testing whether semantic meaning in SID is an equivalence class rather than a procedural artifact.

That’s the heart of your architecture.

Optional (but recommended next)
Once this scenario passes:

duplicate it

tweak one edge weight

or introduce a mild cycle

That becomes scenario_02 and scenario_03.
